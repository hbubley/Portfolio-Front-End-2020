          By way of a scenic, hands-on journey, I have ventured through life in
          search of experience.

          I have...
          <span className="neon">
            lived in Israel, worked with CAD in the engineering field, spent
            time as a preschool teacher and as a vet tech, and gained
            certification as a full-stack software engineer.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these ventures I found myself. I learned that I need
          challenges and I need hard problems to solve. This self-awareness is
          something I value and I feel privliged to call myself a full-stack
          developer.
