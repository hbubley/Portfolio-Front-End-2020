      <p>By way of a scenic, hands-on journey, I have ventured through life in search of experience. I lived in Israel for two years, I worked with CAD in the engineering field, I spenttime as a preschool teacher and a vet tech, and most recently, became certified as a full-stack software engineer.</p>
      <p>Through these ventures I found myself. I learned that I need challenges and I need hard problems to solve. This self-awareness, self-awareness I had worked hard for, is something I value. I feel lucky, grateful even, to feel this emphatically for the software engineering field and the absolute fulfilment it offers me and privliged to call myself a full-stack developer.</p>
      <p>I do not fear failure. I believe in order to really learn and understand something, you must fail. This methodology and practice has drastically bolstered my resilience. I do not give up when presented with an obstacle, rather, I embrace it and find any opportunities for growth along the way.</p>
